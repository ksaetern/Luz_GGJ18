Luz Global Game Jam 2018

The theme for 2018 was transmission. Our idea started from transmission from the depressed heart.
The main character loses someone in a car accident and falls into depression. He has to fight the darkness growing inside him.
The boss character transmits different elemental signals and the player has to match the opposite by using a combination of spheres to
cast the spell.

What we learned:
-Try not to have too many spell options
-People get tired quickly
-Too Steep learning curve
-Even with directions its hard to remember combination for element.
